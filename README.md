# AC6-Regulation-Manager
A simple command line tool to manage modded Regulation files for Armored Core 6

All files the program uses, save for runtime files, are saved in your Documents folder, under "AC6-RM"

To install a regulation into the Regulation manager:

- If the regulation.bin with a regulation.json, create a folder in AC6-RM/Regulations/ and place both files in there.
- If the regulation.bin does not have a regulation.json, use the "Import Regulation into AC6RM" option in the tool.
